        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Hi there!</p>
        <p>My name is Arpit and I created BridgeBill to simplify the process of recording shared expenses and keeping track of who owes what.</p>
        <p>Over the last few years, my friends and I have mostly used BillMonk to split expenses. BillMonk, after the Obopay acquisition, was largely abandoned. Therefore, we needed an application to help us do what BillMonk did. Most other bill splitting applications currently available are feature heavy. We wanted something light and simple. And that's how BridgeBill was born.</p>
